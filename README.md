# templates-ICPC-2020
This repo contains the algorithmic templates for team Fire Enchanted from UChicago

Team name:
Fire Enchanted

Team members:
Goutham Rajendran, Zhongnian Tao, Xifan Yu

University:
University of Chicago

Repository structure:
Right now we plan to classify the templates we will use into five categories (subject to change): graph, string, geometry, arithmetic, misc.

Plan:
We are going to build and maintain this repository in the following manner:
1. Each team member choose and commit algorithm templates, with filename (algorithm)_(team member name)
2. For each template uploaded, design custom tests and test the algorithm template.
3. For each algorithm, review and choose the one that every team member is comfortable with
4. After an algorithm template is chosen, delete the template of the same algorithm uploaded by the other team member.

Template requirements:
1. concise code, easy to type
2. lengthy comment, easy to read
